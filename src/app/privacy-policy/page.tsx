                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">11. How Long We Keep Your PI</h2>
                <p className="mb-4 ms-3">The retention period of your personal information depends on the purpose for which it was collected and how it is used. We will retain your PI only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. For example, if you close your account, we may retain your information for a limited time thereafter to comply with legal requirements or to protect our legal rights.</p>
